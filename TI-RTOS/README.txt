A simple project using a TI-RTOS system running on Texas Instrument's TMS320F development board. 

The system consisted of displaying data in a GUI and indicating the operation of the "kettle" using LEDs on the development board. 

The "Kettlev3" directory contains the GUI, which includes all the switches, displays, etc.

The "Project__RTOS" directory contains the environment settings along with the code responsible for the operation of the entire system.
